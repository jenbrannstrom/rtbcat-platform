# RTB.cat Platform - Architect Handover

**Date:** January 28, 2026  
**Role:** Senior Developer & Architect (Codex)  
**Scope:** Own the roadmap, system architecture, and cross‑cutting decisions.  
**Team:** Claude CLI is the ground‑level implementer.  

---

## 🎯 Executive Purpose (Architect)

Your job is to **keep the long‑term mountain view** and ensure the system converges on the QPS optimizer mission:

1. **Accurate, complete data pipeline** (Gmail → Parquet → BigQuery → Postgres)
2. **Canonical schema alignment** (DATA_MODEL.md is authoritative, but must be reconciled with UI + QPS requirements)
3. **Precompute / aggregation correctness** (summary tables for UI + QPS optimization)
4. **Operational reliability** (automation, recoverability, minimal manual steps)

You are **junior to the written plans and documentation** (DATA_MODEL.md, POSTGRES_MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md, ROADMAP.md, UI specs).  
You are **senior to Claude** and responsible for **delegation, sequencing, and architecture decisions**.

---

## 🧭 Team Protocol

**Roles:**
- **Architect (Codex):** sets architecture, validates alignment with docs, prioritizes risks, sequences work.
- **Claude (ground expert):** executes the detailed tasks, runs migrations, fixes scripts, validates outputs.

**Rule:** If Claude sees a conflict between Codex instructions and written docs/plan, Claude must pause and ask for clarification.

## ✅ Current System Status (Jan 28, 2026)

**Schema & Pipeline:**
- Postgres schema alignment migration `027_schema_alignment.sql` applied on SG VM.
  - Added Postgres raw fact tables: `rtb_daily`, `rtb_bidstream`, `rtb_bid_filtering`, `rtb_quality`
  - Added normalized `pretargeting_publishers`
  - BIGINT upgrades for aggregated tables
- Gmail batch importer works, including OAuth fallback for link‑only emails.
- BigQuery raw_facts coverage: 2026‑01‑11 → 2026‑01‑25.
- Raw fact backfill to Postgres completed:
  - `rtb_daily`: 9,082,712 rows (2026‑01‑07 → 2026‑01‑25)
  - `rtb_bidstream`: 3,547,431 rows (2026‑01‑07 → 2026‑01‑25)
  - `rtb_bid_filtering`: 44,936 rows (2026‑01‑13 → 2026‑01‑25)
- QPS join verification query succeeded (bidstream → daily join returning impressions).

**Aggregations:**
- `home_publisher_daily`, `rtb_publisher_daily` populated through 2026‑01‑25.
- Size/config aggregations re‑enabled with corrected join logic (commit 9f78267); **must be re‑run** to populate `home_size_daily` and `home_config_daily`.

**Source of Truth:**
- `DATA_MODEL.md` updated with canonical QPS requirements and schema gaps.
- `POSTGRES_MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md` updated with pipeline env requirements and schema gap notes.
- `ROADMAP.md` updated with schema alignment + backfill status.

## 🔧 Responsibilities of the Architect

1) **Schema Ownership:** ensure Postgres schema matches canonical model and UI/QPS requirements.  
2) **Data Completeness:** ensure the pipeline fills required fields (report_type, billing_id, creative_size, etc.).  
3) **Aggregation Correctness:** ensure all required summary tables populate and stay in sync.  
4) **Operational Safety:** prefer deterministic, resumable workflows and crash recovery.  
5) **Delegation:** assign ground work to Claude with explicit steps, validation criteria, and rollback plans.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap Execution Sequence (Current)

**Phase A — Canonical Schema Complete**
1. Align Postgres raw fact tables with `DATA_MODEL.md` (done via migration 027).
2. Ensure pipeline writes **report_type** and all required fields into raw facts.
3. Ensure BIGINT for all aggregated counters (done; verify in remaining tables).

**Phase B — Backfill & Re‑aggregation**
4. Backfill new Postgres raw fact tables from BigQuery (BQ → Postgres). ✅ Done
5. Re-enable size/config aggregations once `creative_size` and `billing_id` are consistently present. ✅ Done (commit 9f78267)
6. Re-run aggregation to populate **all** `home_*_daily` and `rtb_*_daily` tables. 🔄 Pending

**Phase C — QPS Optimizer Readiness**
7. Verify QPS optimizer joins work (`rtb_daily` + `rtb_bidstream` + `rtb_bid_filtering` + `rtb_quality`).
8. Validate UI endpoints expect populated summary tables; update if missing.

**Phase D — Automation**
9. Make ingest + pipeline + aggregation fully automatic (nightly or on‑import).
10. Add monitoring for missing coverage gaps (BQ dates, summary table row counts).

---

## 📌 Immediate Tasks (Active)

1) **Re-run aggregation** and confirm populated tables:
   - `home_size_daily`, `home_config_daily` (now re‑enabled)
   - `home_publisher_daily`, `home_geo_daily`, `home_seat_daily`
   - `rtb_funnel_daily`, `rtb_publisher_daily`, `rtb_geo_daily`
2) **Verify QPS optimizer joins** against Postgres raw facts.
3) **Update UI** to consume normalized publisher list (`pretargeting_publishers`).

## 📂 Key Files (Architect should know)

- `DATA_MODEL.md` — canonical schema + gap analysis
- `docs/POSTGRES_MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md` — migration & pipeline steps
- `docs/HANDOVER_CRASH_RECOVERY.md` — crash restart guide
- `scripts/gmail_import.py` / `scripts/gmail_import_batch.py`
- `scripts/export_csv_to_parquet.py`
- `importers/parquet_pipeline.py`
- `scripts/load_parquet_to_bigquery.py`
- `scripts/bq_aggregate_to_pg.py`
- `scripts/bq_backfill_raw_facts.py`

---

## ✅ Operating Principles

- **Follow the docs**: if docs conflict, resolve by updating the docs first.  
- **No silent drift**: changes must be reflected in DATA_MODEL.md + runbook.  
- **Data correctness over speed**: complete, accurate data is mandatory for QPS optimization.  
- **Claude executes, Architect decides**: Claude should not make architectural choices without approval.

## 🛠️ Quick Commands (Single-Place Reference)

**1) Re-run aggregation (BQ → Postgres):**
```bash
python scripts/bq_aggregate_to_pg.py --date-range 2026-01-07 2026-01-25
```

**2) Verify raw fact row counts:**
```sql
SELECT 'rtb_daily' as table_name, COUNT(*), MIN(metric_date), MAX(metric_date) FROM rtb_daily
UNION ALL
SELECT 'rtb_bidstream', COUNT(*), MIN(metric_date), MAX(metric_date) FROM rtb_bidstream
UNION ALL
SELECT 'rtb_bid_filtering', COUNT(*), MIN(metric_date), MAX(metric_date) FROM rtb_bid_filtering;
```

**3) QPS join sanity check:**
```sql
SELECT f.metric_date, f.publisher_id,
       SUM(f.bid_requests) as bid_requests,
       SUM(f.auctions_won) as auctions_won,
       COALESCE(SUM(d.impressions), 0) as impressions_from_daily
FROM rtb_bidstream f
LEFT JOIN rtb_daily d
  ON f.metric_date = d.metric_date
 AND f.country = d.country
 AND f.publisher_id = d.publisher_id
WHERE f.metric_date >= '2026-01-20'
  AND f.publisher_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY f.metric_date, f.publisher_id
ORDER BY bid_requests DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**4) Gmail batch (nohup in container):**
```bash
sudo docker exec catscan-api bash -c "nohup python3 scripts/gmail_import_batch.py --batch-size 10 >> /home/rtbcat/.catscan/logs/gmail_batch.log 2>&1 &"
sudo docker exec catscan-api tail -n 50 /home/rtbcat/.catscan/logs/gmail_batch.log
sudo docker exec catscan-api cat /home/rtbcat/.catscan/gmail_batch_checkpoint.json
```

**5) Backfill raw facts from BigQuery (if needed):**
```bash
python scripts/bq_backfill_raw_facts.py --table rtb_daily --date-range 2026-01-07 2026-01-25
python scripts/bq_backfill_raw_facts.py --table rtb_bidstream --date-range 2026-01-07 2026-01-25
python scripts/bq_backfill_raw_facts.py --table rtb_bid_filtering --date-range 2026-01-13 2026-01-25
```

**6) Restart API container (SG VM):**
```bash
cd /opt/catscan
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.gcp.yml down
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.gcp.yml up -d
```

## 📢 Brief for Successor Architect (“Archie2”)

You are taking over the **architect role**. Claude is executing ground tasks and reports via `docs/ai_logs/ai_log_2026-01-27.md`.  
Your immediate objectives:

1) **Run aggregation now** using `scripts/bq_aggregate_to_pg.py` after commit `9f78267` (fixes join logic for `home_config_daily` and report_type filters).  
2) **Verify** `home_size_daily` and `home_config_daily` populate; then validate UI precompute status.  
3) **Wire UI** to normalized publisher list (`pretargeting_publishers`) via new endpoints in `api/routers/settings/pretargeting.py`.  
4) **Move to automation**: schedule daily Gmail → BQ → Postgres + aggregation refresh, with health checks.

Commit guidance:
- **Keep:** `9f78267` (fixes aggregation logic and API wiring).
- **Hold:** `718f52e` (superseded by 9f78267).

If any conflict arises between code changes and the written docs, **ask the boss first** and propose how to fix and update the docs—do not rewrite the docs unilaterally, since they are coordinated plans.
